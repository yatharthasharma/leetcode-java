# Approach
Loop through the input array and for every element store the index and temperature from input array 
as part of two separate stacks. Also, for every iteration, check if the current temperature is higher than the previously
stored elements in the stack


# Complexity
- Time complexity:
  $O(n)$

- Space complexity:
  $O(n)$
